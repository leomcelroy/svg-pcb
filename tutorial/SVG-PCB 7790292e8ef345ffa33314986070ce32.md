# SVG-PCB

**SVG-PCB is…a browser-based, parametric Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design app**.  

Using a combination of **Javascript code** and **graphical drawing tools**, circuit board designs can be drawn and exported as a SVG, PNG file for production (etching, masking, milling, etc) as well as a JS code file.  

**SVG-PCB**’s functionality is similar to other PCB design, formally called Electronic Design Automation (EDA), software such as Eagle, KiCAD or EasyEDA. While similar in ultimate functionality, **SVG-PCB** has some significant differences from those traditional PCB EDAs, including…  

- No **Schematic** diagram creation  
- No **Ratsnest** feature  
- No **Electrical Rules Check**  
- No **Design Rules Check**  
- No **Auto-routing**  
- Does not require installation...is browser-based  

And of course the most notable difference is that **SVG-PCB** is an EDA that is centered upon Javascript programming...while having some very useful graphical user interface (GUI) features to make for a unique circuit board design experience.  

> **Disclaimer:** While SVG-PCB is easy to use, it is best suited for those with some knowledge and experience with PCB design…who are able to select, place and connect electronic components in a sensible and functional manner to make a working circuit...as well as some level of comfort with all aspects of programming, particularly Javascript.  
> 

**SVG-PCB** is a non-tradional EDA for those who enjoy the logical structure and parametric control...of **drawing with code**.

### Board Design Workflow
<br>

**SVG-PCB**’s design worksflow involves **4 procedures**…  

1. **Importing** component footprints  
2. **Adjusting** the PCB shape and size  
3. **Placing** components on the PCB  
4. **Routing** wire paths between component footprint pads  

The **SVG-PCB** design process will require a combination of selecting and **positioning SVG graphic elements** in the right **Drawing Window** of the interface and **adjusting or writing code** in the left **Coding Window**.  

### **Importing Component Footprints**
<br>

- From the **COMPONENTS** pop-out menu (Top-Right of the **Drawing Window**)…use the **IMPORT** button to find/select component footprints for your board from the **COMPONENT MENU** list  

![2023-02-11 17_01_37-SVG PCB.jpg](SVG-PCB%207790292e8ef345ffa33314986070ce32/2023-02-11_17_01_37-SVG_PCB.jpg)

![2023-02-11 17_04_58-SVG PCB.jpg](SVG-PCB%207790292e8ef345ffa33314986070ce32/2023-02-11_17_04_58-SVG_PCB.jpg)

- **Click once on the desired component to add it** to the component footprint list 

> **Tip:** use the **SEARCH** bar to narrow your component search 
> **Tip:** **Resistor 1206 size** >> discretes/R_1206.json
> **Tip:** **Capacitor 1206 size** >> discretes/C_1206   

**Note:** Descriptive code for imported component footprints will simultaneously appear near the top of the **Code Window**…under the **DECLARE COMPONENTS** section as a **Constant Variable** (const)   

**Ex: LED 1206**
    
```
const LED_1206 = {"A":{"shape":"M -0.037,0.034L 0.027,0.034L 0.027,-0.034L -0037,-0.034L -0.037,0.034",
                       "pos":[-0.055,0],
                       "layers":["F.Cu"],
                       "index":1},
                  "C":{"shape":"M -0.027,0.034L 0.037,0.034L 0.037,-0.034L -0027,-0.034L -0.027,0.034",
                       "pos":[0.055,0],
                       "layers":["F.Cu"],
                       "index":2}}

```
    
- **To DELETE unwanted component footprints**
    - In the **Code Window**…select the descriptive code of the unwanted component from within the **DECLARE COMPONENTS** section...press the DELETE key on the keyboard    

    > **Tip: Triple-click** on a code line to select all the code on that line  

**Note:** the **component properties** listed in the **DECLARE COMPONENTS** code section (such as the pad name or layer) can be edited. *But do so thoughtfully!*   

**Note:** The **COMPONENTS** pop-up menu can be **hidden away** when not in needed…by **clicking on the tab**.  

### Adjust the PCB Shape & Size

- The board **Size & Shape** is defined within the **DECLARE PCB** code section
- **Add/Remove Points** (pt) from the **interior** variable to change the shape of the board  
- The board shape and size can also be changed by dragging **RED Handles** at the vertices of the board shape…or more precisely by adjusting the point’s values in the code  

**Original Shape**

**Adjusted Shape**

![2023-02-11 18_45_01-SVG PCB.jpg](SVG-PCB%207790292e8ef345ffa33314986070ce32/2023-02-11_18_45_01-SVG_PCB.jpg)

![2023-02-11 19_03_12-SVG PCB.jpg](SVG-PCB%207790292e8ef345ffa33314986070ce32/2023-02-11_19_03_12-SVG_PCB.jpg)

### Placing & Naming Components on the PCB

- From the **COMPONENTS** pop-out window’s **FOOTPRINTS** list…drag & drop the graphical icon component to the board area  
- Grab the **RED** component **'handle'** to **Move** the component...and place it on the board    

**Note:** After dropping a component onto the board area…code for the dropped component will appear in the **ADD COMPONENT** section of the code

- **ROTATE** the component by changing the ‘**rotate:**’ value of the component’s code  
- Adjust the component’s displayed **name** and **value** by editing the ‘**name:**’ property  

    - ex: “R_1206” > “R1 100k”  
    - ex: “C_1206” > “C1 100uF”  

> **KEY Tip:** make each component into a ‘**const**’ variable with a short and simple name, such as “xiao”, “C1”, etc.  Doing this will make **WIRING** in the next step much more efficient.
<br>

    ```
    const SAMD =  board.add(SAMD11C, { translate: pt(-0.03, 0.01, rotate: 0, name: "SAMD11C" })  
    ```

> **Tip:** List the added components from top to bottom…with components whose position will be dependent on another component below the component it references.

### Routing Wire Between Component Pads

This is where **SVG-PCB** departs from the methodologies of other EDAs. Instead of utilizing a GUI to parametrically arrange components on the PCB, **SVG-PCB** uses Javascript code to do the same.  While it may feel a bit unintuitive at difficult at first, the logic and rationale of this method...along with some its advantages...will make itself clear over time.  With that said...let's WIRE! 

> **Key Note:** **Wiring** between component pads in SVG-PCB is done most efficiently in the **Coding Window** in the **ADD WIRES** code section…using the **Const Variable Name** created in the **ADD COMPONENT** section.  

**SVG-PCB Wiring Procedure Overview**  

- Roughly position components on the board first…before **Wiring**…start with the major components (these will be the positional 'reference' components for other components' relative positions)  
- In its simplest form, **SVG-PCB WIRING** requires specification of a **Start-Point Pad** from one component (the Reference Component) and an **End-Point Pad**  from a second component (the Dependent Component)  
- **Intermediate Points** are added in between the **Start** and **End** points...as required or desired...to shape the line  
- All **Pads** and **Points** drawn in SVG-PCB are drawn on a **Cartesian Coordinate System**...and have **X and Y coordinates** associated with them  
- Because **SVG-PCB** board designs are described by Javascript codes...the numbers representing the **XY coordinates** can be substituted by **Variable Descriptors**  

Let's take a look at an example...
  
This is the generic code to create a **WIRE**…  

```jsx
board.wire(path(), 0.03)
```

- The ‘**board.wire**’ command takes two parameters…**line path,** **wire width**  
- **0.03mm** is the default wire width  
- In between the parenthesis following the ‘**path**’ command…you will specify the **starting point, intermediate point(s)** and **end point** of the line.
- These **POINTs** (RED dots) for a polyline will be specified using the **pt(x-coordinate, y-coordinate)** command  
- To make it possible to draw a polyline **WIRE** graphically in the **Drawing Window…**
    - Click in **between the parenthesis** following the **PATH** command…i.e. place the blinking cursor there...and this will make 'drawing' the path graphically possible  
    
    ![2023-02-23 16_07_44-SVG PCB.jpg](SVG-PCB%207790292e8ef345ffa33314986070ce32/2023-02-23_16_07_44-SVG_PCB.jpg)
    
    - In the **Drawing Window**…click on the locations of the start, intermediates and end **POINTs**  
    <br>
    
    ![2023-02-23 16_08_34-SVG PCB.jpg](SVG-PCB%207790292e8ef345ffa33314986070ce32/2023-02-23_16_08_34-SVG_PCB.jpg)
    
- For example…

```jsx
board.wire(path(
  pt(-0.100, 0.100),
  pt(-0.2, 0.1),
  pt(-0.25, 0.400),), 0.03);
```

> But **the BEST way to create WIRE connections** **between two components**…is to specify a pad from one component as the starting point, a pad from another component as the end point, and points in between (as required)  
<br>

- The pads of every component has a unique number or name  
<br>

> By using **Pad Names** in combination with the **Const Variable Name** assigned to components in the previous step…explicit and fixed connections between 2 components can be specified  
<br>

- **Pad Names + Const Variable Component Names** can also be used as **Reference Coordinates** to position Intermediate Points  

    **ex:** Utilize the X-coordinate of one pad and the Y-coordinate of the other pad

- The **syntax for referencing a component’s pad name** is...
    - the component’s variable name +  
    - .  +  
    - the word “pad” +  
    - the name of the pad in parenthesis and surrounded by quotes   
- Ex: To specify the “**GND**” pad for the “**SAMD11C**” component, you would write…  
```jsx
SAMD.pad("GND")

```

- **Pad Names** can also be used as **Reference Coordinates** for a **WIRE** vertex point ****to align with…by using **padX** and **.padY**…instead of just **.pad**  
- Ex: To specify the **Y-coordinate** of the “**GND**” pad for the “**SAMD11C**” component as a reference point, you would write…  
```jsx
SAMD.padY("GND)
```
- Ex: To create a 3-point for a wire between the SAMD “**GND**” pad and the R1 “**1**” pad, you may write something like this..  
    - SAMD “GND”…as the starting point  
    - R1 “1”…as the end point  
    - ..and an intermediate point that references the SAMD “GND” pad’s y-coordinate and R1 “1” pad’s x-coordinate  

```jsx
board.wire(path(SAMD.pad("GND"), //starting point, GND pad of SAMD11C
               pt(R1.padX("1"), SAMD.padY("GND")), //Intermediate point referencing the X-position of the resistor pad 1 and Y-position of the SAMD GND pad
               R1.pad("1")), 0.03); //end point, resistor 1 pad 1 & wire width of 0.03
```

![Alt text](exampleWire.jpg)

**Note: Pad Names** can be edited or changed in the component description in the **DECLARE COMPONENTS** section  (but do this with great care!)
